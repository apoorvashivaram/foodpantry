Codebook for foodpantry.csv dataset

subject_number: Uniquely identified subject number of family unit (1-220) using pre-numbered shopping carts.
signs_condition: Were signs displayed in the food pantry? if yes, identified as "up", if no, identified as "no signs".
signs_up: Five days during which the data were collected. When signs were not displayed, identified as "no signs 1" and "no signs 2". When signs were displayed, identified as "signs up 1", "signs up 2", and "signs up 3".
type_signs_acad_rel: Type of sign displayed ("academically-relevant" or "non-academically-relevant"). Nested within "up" condition from the "signs_condition" variable.
signs: Four types of signs used - "number", "colors & shapes", "one word answers", "pronouncements". Number (signs that asked questions about number-related concepts such as counting), color & shape (signs that asked questions about colors and shapes), one-word answers (signs that asked questions that typically had a one-word response) or pronouncements (broad statements proclaiming that reading and learning was important to prepare children for school). The first two signs (number and colors & shapes) were nested within "academically-relevant" signs in the "type_signs_acad_rel" variable. The last two signs (one word answers and pronouncements) were nested within the "non-academically-relevant" signs in the "type_signs_acad_rel" variable. These themes of the signs (number, color & shape, one-word answers, pronouncements) were a within-subject variable â€“ that is, all families saw all four signs. These signs were counterbalanced across the different aisles on the three different days of the signs-up condition.
aisle: Aisle in the food pantry where the observation took place (dry goods, freezer, bread, produce).
